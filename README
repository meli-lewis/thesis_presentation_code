This experiment is a replication from the article
"Errors Are Aversive: Defensive Motivation and the Error-Related
Negativity" by Greg Hajcak and Dan Foti (2008).

I'm running it as part of the Reproducibility Project, which you
can learn more about at http://openscienceframework.org/.

I'll assume, if you're planning on using what I post here, that you're
already familiar with Presentation. I'm including here my experiment,
the scenario files used therein, the .sdf I used for logging simple
information like reaction time and accuracy, and -- while it's not
generally encouraged, the JPGs I used for stimuli for now while I
figure out Git and whether I can just put a URL here pointing to the
JPGs stored elsewhere.
