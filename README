This experiment is a replication from the article
"Errors Are Aversive: Defensive Motivation and the Error-Related
Negativity" by Greg Hajcak and Dan Foti (2008).

I'm running it as part of the Reproducibility Project, which you
can learn more about at http://openscienceframework.org/.

I'll assume, if you're planning on using what I post here, that you're
already familiar with Presentation. I'm including here my experiment,
the scenario files used therein, and the .sdf I used for logging simple
information like reaction time and accuracy.

For the JPGs I call in the code, download from the Flickr set I made for them here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/meli-lewis/sets/72157633108640097

I always first presented practice (but without recording EEG -- you'll notice that the stimulus and response port codes are identical between "practice" and "replication," which you'll want to change if you plan to record during the practice session also), then replication. Presentation order of extension A (high points, low anxiety condition) and extension B (low points, high anxiety condition) were counterbalanced.
